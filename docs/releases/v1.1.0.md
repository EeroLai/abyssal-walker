# abyssal-walker v1.1.0

## Highlights
- Added chain-related skill support and a new beam chain skill: Arc Lightning.
- Added enemy ranged attacks with dedicated enemy projectile behavior.
- Improved combat feel and build viability through multiple balance updates.

## Added
- New skill tag flow for `chain`.
- New Arc Lightning skill content and data wiring.
- Enemy projectile scene/script behavior for ranged monster attacks.
- Debug test flow: early access to all skill gems and extra white-quality backup weapons.

## Changed
- Arc Lightning behavior changed to beam-based chaining (not projectile travel).
- Skill/support parsing and display now include chain-related stats.

## Fixed
- Fixed invalid `take_damage` argument issue caused by previously freed projectile references.
- Fixed typed-array return path mismatch issues in player logic.

## Balance
- Dagger-related skills attack speed increased.
- Shadow Tide single-hit performance and damage multiplier increased.
- Damage variance changed to `+/-8%` (kept as tunable constants).
- Reduced enemy elemental resistance pressure to improve elemental build value.

## Upgrade Notes
- No migration step required for local development workflow.
- For contributors: continue feature work on short-lived feature branches and merge back into `main`.
